 <h5>The regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating artificial intelligence (AI);[269][270] it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms. The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally, including in the European Union.[271] Regulation is considered necessary to both encourage AI and manage associated risks.[272][273] Regulation of AI through mechanisms such as review boards can also be seen as social means to approach the AI control problem.[274]
